## Key Features:
- **Code-Free Operation:** Say goodbye to complex coding! AutoConvNet allows you to configure CNN architectures with a simple point-and-click interface, eliminating the need for manual coding during the model training process.
- **Real-Time Training Updates:** Witness the model's training process unfold with the software's live update feature. Track key metrics, assess convergence, and make informed decisions throughout the training journey.
- **Versatile Model Performance Metrics:** Evaluate your model with precision using a variety of performance metrics. Dive into accuracy, losses, errors, True and False positives and negatives, as well as Micro and Macro F1, Precision, and Recall.
- **Dynamic Feature Maps:** Explore the inner workings of your model with dynamic feature maps. Visualize extracted patterns and features from images, gaining insights into how your model interprets input data.
- **Download Model State and Trace:** Capture the state of your model by downloading its weights as a .pth file. Additionally, download the trace of th emodel as a .pt file. These files provide flexibility-continue training, put the model into production, or explore the inner workings of the trained model.
