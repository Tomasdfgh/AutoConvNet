## Key Features:
- **Code-Free Operation:** Say goodbye to complex coding! AutoConvNet allows you to configure CNN architectures with a simple point-and-click interface, eliminating the need for manual coding during the model training process.
- **Real-Time Training Updates:** Witness the model's training process unfold with the software's live update feature. Track key metrics, assess convergence, and make informed decisions throughout the training journey.
- **Versatile Model Performance Metrics:** Evaluate your model with precision using a variety of performance metrics. Dive into accuracy, losses, errors, True and False positives and negatives, as well as Micro and Macro F1, Precision, and Recall.
- **Dynamic Feature Maps:** Explore the inner workings of your model with dynamic feature maps. Visualize extracted patterns and features from images, gaining insights into how your model interprets input data.
- **Download Model State and Trace:** Capture the state of your model by downloading its weights as a .pth file. Additionally, download the trace of th emodel as a .pt file. These files provide flexibility-continue training, put the model into production, or explore the inner workings of the trained model.

## How to Use:
1. **Model Configuration (Step One):** Seamlessly input your data, supporting various formats such as .jpg files, .csv files, and binary files (.bin). Customize your model architecture with the option to use pre-trained models. Specify the width and height to resize the images, or choose from popular CNN architectures. If you don't have a dataset available, you can explore the provided datasets above.
2. **Fill in Hyperparameters and Data Split (Step Two):** Set batch sizes, learning rates, and other essential hyperparameters. Furthermore, determine the training, validation, and testing split to configure your dataset. Once this step is done, the result will appear in the architecture bar.

## Target Audience:

- **Students:** Perfect for those learning intricacies of CNN model training, offering a code-free entry into the world of deep learning.
- **Researchers:** Accelerate your research by training CNN models in minutes and gain insights into model behavior through dynamic feature maps.

AutoConvNet simplifies the complexities of CNN model training, putting the power of deep learning at your fingertips. Go nuts!
